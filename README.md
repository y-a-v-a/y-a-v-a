# Yet Another Visual Artist

> Visual artist and self-taught developer | 20 years of coding | Pioneering vibe coding

I'm formally educated as a visual artist and have been coding since 2005. I work at the intersection of art, code, and creative technology, operating under the moniker[ **y-a-v-a.org**](https://www.y-a-v-a.org) (Yet Another Visual Artist). Currently serving as Digital Tech Manager at apparel company [G-STAR](https://www.g-star.com).

My creative work always evolves around mathematical challenges or interests, clear visual outcome, anti-attitudes and artistic and technical protocols/conventions. "The pixels are the message."

I like to build stuff quickly, call it digital impressionism, and iterative experimentation, but I also cherish old projects or work for months on something that's not yet good enough. Vibe coding, preferably with Claude, supports me in bringing this further; I love coding with AI.

### Vibe Coding

In March 2025 I discovered AI-assisted coding, or "vibe coding". I've been exploring how tools like Claude Code, Codex or [Aider.chat](https://aider.chat/) accelerate development and enable a more fluid, creative approach to building software. I've given several presentations on this methodology. Check out the [slide decks here](https://github.com/y-a-v-a/vibe-code-lab-slides).
