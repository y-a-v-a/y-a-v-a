# Vincent Bruijn (y-a-v-a)

Visual artist and self-taught developer | 20 years of coding | Pioneering vibe coding

## About

I'm formally educated as a visual artist and have been coding since 2005. I work at the intersection of art, code, and creative technology, operating under the moniker **y-a-v-a.org** (Yet Another Visual Artist). Currently serving as Digital Tech Manager at apparel company G-STAR.

My creative work always evolves around mathematical challenges or interests, clear visual outcome, anti-attitudes and artistic and technical protocols/conventions. I like to build stuff quickly, call it digital impressionism, and iterative experimentation, but I also cherish old projects or work for months on something that's not yet good enough. Vibe coding, preferably with Claude, supports me in bringing this further; I love coding with AI.

## What I Do

### AI-Assisted Development (Vibe Coding)

In March 2025 I discovered AI-assisted coding, or "vibe coding". I've been exploring how tools like Claude Code accelerate development and enable a more fluid, creative approach to building software. I've given several presentations on this methodology. Check out the [slide decks here](https://github.com/y-a-v-a/vibe-code-lab-slides).

### Technical Work

**Languages:** JavaScript & TypeScript (professional experience), Rust (since 2021), PHP, C++, HTML/CSS

**Focus areas:** Web development, web apps, graphics programming, algorithmic art, protocol art

**Notable projects:**
- [node-gd](https://github.com/y-a-v-a/node-gd) — GD graphics library bindings for Node.js
- [msaada](https://github.com/y-a-v-a/msaada) — Lightweight local HTTP server built in Rust
- Various creative coding experiments and tools

### Generative & Algorithmic Art

I create computational recreations of classic artists and conceptual web projects. "The pixels are the message."
